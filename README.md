A tool to bring a little order in the chaos of task / issue management.

## What is this ?

A small tool to keep your task management app (like Todoist) and your repository issues (be it Jira, BitBucket, GitLab issues or GitHub issues) in sync. (e.g. when you create a issue in the repo, automatically create a task in Todoist, when you check off the task in Todoist, automatically mark the issue as solved, etc.)

## Motivation

I've been struggling to find a workflow that suits me in managing all of the various task/issues that I have in many projects.
I've been looking around for a solution to integrate a task management app (like Todoist) with the various issue systems in
git repository platforms (GitHub, Bitbucket, JIRA, GitLab, etc.) but all had some issues. The one that bugged me the most is that you have to maintain two systems for each project, if you want to have all your projects in one place.

## Why not Zapier/IFTT/etc ?

I found them to be too general purpose, or too expensive, to do what I want - a simple developer-focused tool to sync my issues with Todoist.

## I wanna try it!

It's still in the planning stages, but feel free to add your opinions if you are interested. I'll be updating this repo as I go on with developing this tool.
